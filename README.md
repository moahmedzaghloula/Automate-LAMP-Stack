## ‚ú® What This Project Does

This playbook automates a full LAMP stack setup, perfect for development, testing, or learning:
- **Apache**: Serves a cheerful `index.php` to confirm PHP is working flawlessly.
- **MySQL**: Installs a secure database with a root password, removing anonymous users and test databases.
- **PHP**: Powers dynamic web content, seamlessly linked with Apache.

**Why it‚Äôs special**:
- **Roles**: Organized into `apache`, `mysql`, and `php` for clarity and reuse.
- **Error Handling**: Uses `block`, `rescue`, and `always` to catch issues gracefully.
- **Handlers**: Restarts services like Apache and MySQL only when needed.
- **Modularity**: Tasks are split logically, making updates a breeze.
